## Description
This project utilizes a pre-built appication for the purpose of being built upon to demonstrate the use of effective testing for making sustainable, by allowing the student (myself) to incorporate, & configure, Cypress. 

## Installation
Clone the repo, and run the following from the CLI of the root:

```bash
npm i
npm run build
npm run seed
```

After these initial commands, split the terminal, and do one of the following:

Option 1 (Launch header for both e2e & component tests):

```bash
npm run start:dev 
npm run cypress
```

Option 2 (ONLY runs component IN console):

```bash
npm run start:dev
npm cypress run
```

NOTE: Make sure to configure your .env based off the .env.EXAMPLE. (May req IPV4 config, ie. 127.0.0.1:27017/)
